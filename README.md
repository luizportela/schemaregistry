# Terraform provider for Confluent Kafka Schema Registry

This terraform provider allows you to interact with Confluent Kafka Schema Registry.

There are a few requirements about how the API must work for this provider to be able to do its thing:
* The API is expected to support the following HTTP methods:
    * POST: create or update a schema
    * DELETE: remove a schema

Have a look at the [examples directory](examples) for some use cases

You can place the file in the directory of your .tf file in `terraform.d/plugins/{OS}_{ARCH}/` or place it in your home directory at `~/.terraform.d/plugins/{OS}_{ARCH}/`

Once downloaded, be sure to make the plugin executable by running `chmod +x terraform-provider-schemaregistry`.
